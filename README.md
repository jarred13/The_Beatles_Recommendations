# The_Beatles_Recommendations

This notebook uses unsupervised learning to cluster all the beatles songs into song types. The data used was a data set found on Kaggle and it has Spotify's data for all 13 Beatles albumns, which include 192 songs. The k-means algorithm was applied to create a two dimensional and three dimensional model. The three dimensional model was used to make a simple recommendation system where you provide a Beatles song and the recommender will return a similar song from that cluster!

As a Beatles fan, this was a fun notebook to create and I hope you enjoy reading it, just as much as I enjoyed creating it!
