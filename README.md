# The_Beatles_Recommendations

# Overview
This notebook uses unsupervised learning to cluster all the Beatles songs into song types. The data used was a dataset found on Kaggle and it has Spotify's data for all 13 Beatles albumns, which includes 192 songs. The k-means algorithm was applied to create a two dimensional and three dimensional model. The three dimensional model was used to make a simple recommendation system where you provide a Beatles song and the recommender will return a similar song from that cluster! As a Beatles fan, this was a fun notebook to create and I hope you enjoy reading it, just as much as I enjoyed creating it! This notebook is hosted on Kaggle and can be found here:

# Purpose of this Project
This project was designed to be a starting point for practicing and understanding K-means clustering and unsupervised learning. I wanted to learn how to use the insights from a K-means model to turn those insights into a recommedation system.

# What Did I Learn
I learned a great deal about K-means models. I learned how to use the elbow method and the silhouette method in order to choose the optimal number of clusters. I learned how to create a 2 dimensional model as well as a 3 dimensional model. I learned how to create a function in python that could return a recommended song. As well as learning how to plot 3 dimensional plots in the Plotly library.

# Dataset Used
This dataset consists of 192 songs from all 13 of the Beatles albums. The dataset was found on Kaggle and has 11 song features for each song.
